# Notices:
# - Don't replace the '<user-input>' placeholder in this file, the application will prompt you to enter a value when it runs.
# - Manually save the file will create the connection after basic validation.
# - The connection information will be stored in a local database with api_key encrypted for safety.
# - Prompt flow will ONLY use the connection information (incl. keys) when instructed by you, e.g. manage connections, use connections to run flow etc.
# - All the values should be string type, please use "123" instead of 123 or "True" instead of True.

# - You have several ways to get such info:
#   1. Go to the AOAI studio, open playground, view code, then you can get what you need;
#   2. Go to the AOAI studio, settings -- resource -- list of resoruce, endpoint is api_base and key is api_key;
#   3. Go to the Azure portal, find your AOAI resource, and then get the keys.
